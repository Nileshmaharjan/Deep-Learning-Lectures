<h3>What is Computer Vision?</h3> Computer Vision is a field of AI which enables computer machines to deduct meaningful information from visual inputs like images and videos. It tries to understand the human visual behavior and automate it. Object Detection, Video Tracking are some of the application examples of computer Vision.

<h3>History of Computer Vision</h3> 

* Computer Vision started at around 1960s to understand the human visual behavior.
* David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel provided a giant leap in understanding of the human visual system through numerous experiments.
* One of their most famous experiment was the Cat Experiment they conducted in 1959.This experiment was a landmark in exploring the role of neuron organization in the human brain to produce visual perception.

* In 1966, Seymour Papert started a famous MIT project called "The Summer Vision Project."
* The primary goal of the project was to construct a system of programs which will divide a picture into regions such as likely objects, likely background areas etc.
* In the late 1970s, David Mar wrote an influential book on Computer Vision.The book is about what he thinks vision is.

* Around 1999 AD to 2000 AD, statistical machine learning techniques started to gain momentum. 
* Real-time Face Detection was one of the influential work done at that time.
* In the early 2000s, we began to have benchmark datasets that enabled to measure the progress in Object Detection.
* One of the most influential dataset is known as "PASCAL Visual Object Challenge."
* PASCAL Visual Object Challenge is a dataset consisting of 20 object categories.
* In 2006, Fujifilm created the first digital camera that had a real time face detector.So, it was a very fast progress in terms of basic science projects to real world applications.
* Starting from 2009, IMAGENET team started a global challenge called "IMAGENET Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge."
