<h3>Introduction to Convolution Neural Networks</h3>
Convolution Neural Networks are specific architecture of Neural Networks that are highly effective at dealing with image data.

<h3>What do you mean by Convolution layers in Convolution Neural Network?</h3>

Convolution layers are created in neural networks when multiple image filters are applied to the input image. The layer can be trained to figure out the best possible filter weight values. Basically, a convolution layer transforms the input image data and extract features from it.

<h3>What are Image Kernels in Convolution Neural Networks?</h3>

[Image Kernels ](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/) are small matrices used to apply effects such as blurring or sharpening images. In machine learning, they are used for the feature extraction process to determine the important portions of an image. An image kernel size is samller than the input image.
